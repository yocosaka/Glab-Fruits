## About the Project

This project is to build a platform game with **Phaser** library.
It was built as the JavaScript capstone project at Microverse.

In this project, I did these things:

- Planned the game overview and specific mechanic with [Game Design Document(GDD)](./game-design-document.md)
- Built platform game with [Phaser library](https://phaser.io/phaser3)
- Implemented a scoring system using the given API to save the score with a username and display it in a game view
- Deployed to a server so the game is accessible for anyone

Also, these features are added:

- Three modes: Easy, normal, and hard that is different on the speed of showing enemies and fruits
- Double jump: The main character can double jump

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
